# Interactive Seat Map Prototypes

Using jQuery, jQuery UI, and CodeCanyon SmoothZoom, I have built several interactive seat map prototypes to work with SVG maps.

## Installation

I highly recommend using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension on your Visual Studio Code. Then run it with the html files I have starting with `index.html`
